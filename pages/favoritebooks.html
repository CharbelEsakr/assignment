                My favorite book is the Holy Bible, I chose this book because is an inspiration for me, I like this book because it has proved an influence point in my life. I have learnt a lot from this great book. It remains one of the most precious treasures of mankind. It makes a very good reading. Every sentence of this book has a touch of sincerity. It is written in a simple but effective style. It is worth reading.The Holy Bible has really taught me how to lead a life given to Jesus, and he has shown me through his word his compassion, his love, his mercy that are great every day, his patience and forgiveness that although we don't deserve them, he grant us. The Holy Bible is not only a book replete with laws and commandments, but also includes…show more content…God has treated us with dignity by giving us free will, the power to make our own decisions. Neither he nor fate controls our life. The Bible supports that, Deuteronomy 30:19) “This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before your life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live.” But nevertheless we humans take advantage of the free will, which God has given us, to be the evil as this specified. (Isaiah 30:1) "Woe to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin.However, even God shows us his compassion and forgives us for all our sins, that is why he does not want any of us to be lose, that he loves us so much that he was able to send his only son to earth to come and save us as. He emphasize in the bible. (John 3:16) “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” <a href="./ReadBible.html">Read ESV bible here</a>
